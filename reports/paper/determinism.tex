\section{Determinism}

In this language 

\begin{theorem}[The FlowPool abstraction is deterministic]
The reduction of terms $t$ is deterministic.
\end{theorem}

The proof is based on commutativity of transitions in the reduction.

\begin{lemma}
Consider a reduction sequence $S$ that does not contain a transition which creates a new pool.
If $S$ terminates with result $P$ then all permutations of $S$ terminate with the same result.
\end{lemma}
